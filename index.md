This page belogs to Florian Kirchschlager and is in development. Proposed completion date is January 2019.

My name is Florian Kirchschlager, and Iâ€™m an astrophysicist studying dust in circumstellar disks and supernova remnants. 

I am since May 2017 in the group of Prof. Dr. Mike J. Barlow at the University College London (UCL). Before moving to UCL I was at Kiel University in the work group of Prof. Dr. Sebastian Wolf.
